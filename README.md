# 🌍 World Explorer

World Explorer is a Flutter mobile application focused on **visual geography learning** and **world exploration** using a **level-based quiz system**, with plans to expand into a global places discovery experience.

## 📱 App Overview

The app contains a main menu with the following sections:

- **Start** – country guessing game (levels)
- **The World** – future world exploration section
- **Options**

## 🎮 Start — Quiz Mode (current)

This is the main implemented feature.

### Level System
- Levels are displayed in a **grid layout** (Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, etc.).
- Each level represents **one country**.
- Levels are selectable through the **Start** menu.

### Gameplay Logic
- A level presents **multiple visual clues** related to one country.
- The user enters the country name using a text input field.
- The **Check** button validates the answer.

### Result Flow
- If the answer is correct:
  - The correct country name is shown.
  - A **Next** button appears to continue to the next level.
